Let's say we have to install MySQL:

1. https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres

2. docker run --name postgress -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres

3. Build a Dockerfile

4. Need to move the above image to a Kubernetes Statefulset and expose this via LoadBalancer service.

5. Despite doing this, you're not sure that this is the best solution to deploy Kubernetes.

6. Helm workflow instead.
